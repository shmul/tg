PLEASE NOTE:

This isnt sourced from the 2CD "Thesaurus of Funkasaurus" bootleg. 

Instead its a superior source :-)

Lineage:  1971 VPRO FM broadcast>Revox Reel2Reel-deck>WAV>FLAC

Pristine Stereo Soundboard

The sound on this transfer is much more lively and its also (more) complete compared to  what can be found on boots (that i'm aware of, anyway) There's a little FM dropout in the right channel during the start of Stand, thats the only flaw I could find.


A Lossy version of this can be found on the VPRO site, from a 2003 re-broadcast

Enjoy and in case you're wondering if this any better than the version you have let me assure you : Yes, its very likely a upgrade in sound quality, and also likely the complete show.
