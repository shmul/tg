January 21, 1972
Het Concertgebouw
Amsterdam
The Netherlands

From vinyl LP
LP label: Offshore Records OF722

This is taken from my own bootleg LP 'White Yes Album'.
The LP was professionally cleaned, digitized to WAVE 96/24 and click-repaired by Gromek.
I converted it myself to FLAC 96/24 using Adobe Audition CC2014.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gromek notes:
Recorded using CoolEdit Pro 2.1 on an Asus NV76VZ laptop, running Windows 8.1 64bit, via external Creative Soundblaster X-Fi HD soundcard, from Akai AP-306c turntable with standard MM cartridge, with anti-static brush and 786 gram record weight, good quality cables.

Clicks were repaired to a level that would not compromise the recording.

ClickRepair setting: CR-25, DC-2, Reverse, x2 method.
Louder clicks were repaired (very, very carefully) using Cool Edit Pro 2.1.

This version was editted using Cool Edit Pro 2.1 to remove unwanted silences, to paste side one and side two together to create a better flow, and to separate into individual tracks. 
Nothing else was done, no remastering, no channel fixing, no source mixing, nothing.

Keep in mind that this is a vinyl recording, and that there will always be vinyl artefacts to be heard.

So here it is, warts and all (though some warts were treated):

YES, LIVE, IN, HET CONCERTGEBOUW, AMSTERDAM, JANUARY 21, 1972


--- PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ADJUST, THE BASS, THE TREBLE AND WHATEVER YOU WANT TO, ON YOUR OWN EQUIPMENT, TO PRODUCE THE BEST POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE IN YOUR OWN PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT ---

PLAY IT LOUD! (but be careful).

A big THANK YOU to Gromek!
