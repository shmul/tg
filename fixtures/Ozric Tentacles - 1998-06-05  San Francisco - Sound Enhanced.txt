Big Thanks to glasnostrd19 for sharing this source.

 
This show was to promote their album "curious corn"
and to prepare for their "spice doubt" 
live recording 2 days later.

The Band is on fire, it's a great concert, Every track is amazing! the keyboards played during this show are nothing short of astounding! The way it all blends together is perfect. The guitar playing is also sublime.  

I spent a lot of time on this project and it was well worth it. To my ears this sounds better than their actual live album. But you be the judge.

The original source was out of phase and lacking a bottom end. I have beefed up the bottom end and corrected the phase issue. I also cleaned up a few artifacts and smoothed out all the track transitions.

This recording is now much fuller with great midrange and highs you wont be disapointed.   This rework puts you right in the seats!   

                         !!!!You want to play this LOUD!!!!!
